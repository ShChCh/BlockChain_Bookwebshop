TIPS: (download SourceTree client to make things easilier)

1. The most important thing is : Do not post to master branch!

2. Start a task:   

	create a branch (copy from team branch), using task's code as branch's code

3. Clone your own new branch to local disk, do whatever u want, and then commit to your own branch.

4. When u FINISHED your local test, which also means u finished your task, create a request for merge : your own branch -> team

5. Make sure when your merge requests have been approved, test with the new team branch, if u find any problems, call your teammates ASAP.

6. Each commit must have a clear description for track and future debug, here's an example:

	[Author Name]:
	[Date]:
	[Task Code]:
	[Modules modified]:
	[Modules may be influenced]:
	[Description of the task]:

7. Once there's a conflict, contact your teammates who may be responsible to those modules. (see the description of each commits).


8. If u use an opensource lib or anything in this project, please carefully read their licenses.
